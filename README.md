Jeevan ensures that every voice is heard — and acted upon.

# 🧠 Core Innovations
## 🗣️ Bhasha-First Conversational Intelligence
Jeevan understands code-switched Indian speech, like:
> *“Mujhe bukhaar aur body pain hai”* → Maps correctly to Fever → General Medicine

It recognizes multiple ways of saying the same thing across languages and dialects.

## 🧬 Symptom-Based Triage
Jeevan doesn’t just book — it thinks like a nurse.

Example:

> *“My child has fever and rashes”*

  ***→ Pediatrician (not General Medicine)***

> “I feel breathless and dizzy”

  ***→ Emergency / Cardiology***

## ❤️ Empathetic AI
Jeevan detects distress, urgency, and fear. </br>
If a patient says:
+ “Seene mein dard” (chest pain)
+ “Emergency”
+ “Accident”
+ “Unconscious”

Jeevan instantly exits booking mode and:
+ Alerts emergency staff
+ Transfers to ambulance desk
+ Shares emergency helpline

No waiting. No menus. Just action.

## 📞 Low-Bandwidth Friendly
Works on: </br>
+ Feature phones
+ 2G networks
